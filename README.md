**1. Introduction**

This document describes the automated process for sending personalized outreach emails to contacts listed in an Excel spreadsheet, tracking the sending status, and generating a daily progress report. The process is executed by a Python script designed to increase efficiency and provide visibility into the campaign's execution.

**2. Purpose**

The primary purpose of this process is to:

*   Automate the sending of personalized outreach emails from a predefined list.
*   Ensure that each contact receives the email only once.
*   Provide real-time (or near real-time) tracking of which contacts have been sent an email.
*   Generate a daily summary report of the campaign's progress.

**3. Scope**

**In Scope:**

*   Reading recipient data (Email, First Name, Last Name) from a specified Excel file.
*   Identifying recipients who have not yet been sent an email based on a status column.
*   Sending personalized emails using a provided template, inserting the recipient's First Name.
*   Sending emails at random time intervals.
*   Updating the status of sent emails directly within the same Excel file.
*   Generating a daily report summarizing the number of emails sent and remaining.
*   Sending the daily report via email to a predefined list of recipients.

**Out of Scope:**

*   Managing email bounces, unsubscribes, or replies.
*   Handling errors beyond basic logging (e.g., sophisticated retry mechanisms).
*   Advanced segmentation or targeting of recipients.
*   Detailed analytics beyond the simple count of sent vs. remaining emails.
*   User interface for managing the process or viewing status (relies solely on the Excel file and report email).
*   Maintaining historical records of daily progress (only the latest daily report is sent).

**4. Actors / Roles**

*   **System (Python Script):** Performs the automated tasks (reading, sending, updating, reporting).
*   **Data Provider:** Provides and potentially updates the initial Excel file.
*   **Recipient:** Individual receiving the personalized outreach email.
*   **Report Recipient:** Individual receiving the daily progress report email.

**5. Inputs**

*   **Recipient Data File (Excel):** An Excel file (`.xlsx` or `.xls`) containing at least the following columns:
    *   `Email` (required)
    *   `FirstName` (required for personalization)
    *   `LastName` (optional, but good for record keeping)
    *   `Status` (will be used and updated by the system)
*   **Email Configuration:**
    *   Sender Email Address
    *   SMTP Server Details (Host, Port, Username, Password/App Password)
    *   Email Subject Line
    *   Email Body Template (as provided in the prompt, with `(Name)` placeholder)
*   **Reporting Configuration:**
    *   List of Hardcoded Report Recipient Email Addresses (3 in this case).
    *   Definition of "End of Day" (e.g., a specific time, or 24 hours after start).

**6. Outputs**

*   **Sent Outreach Emails:** Personalized emails delivered to recipients.
*   **Updated Recipient Data File (Excel):** The input Excel file modified with '✅' in the 'Status' column for each recipient that has been sent an email.
*   **Daily Progress Report (Content):** A text or simple formatted string summarizing the campaign's progress.
*   **Sent Daily Report Email:** Email containing the progress report sent to the specified recipients.
*   **(Implicit) Log Files:** Record of script execution, potentially including successes and errors.

    L --> |Yes| M[Generate Daily Report];
    M --> N[Send Daily Report Email];
    N --> D; // After report, continue processing pending or check if done
```

**8. Detailed Process Steps**

1.  **Initialize Process:**
    *   The Python script is started.
    *   Configuration details (Excel file path, SMTP settings, report recipients, timing parameters) are loaded.

2.  **Load Recipient Data:**
    *   The script accesses and reads the specified Excel file.
    *   It parses the data, expecting columns named 'Email', 'FirstName', 'LastName', and 'Status'.
    *   The data is stored in memory in a structured format (e.g., a list of dictionaries).

3.  **Identify Pending Recipients:**
    *   The script filters the loaded data to create a list of recipients for whom the 'Status' column is empty or does not contain '✅'. These are the recipients who still need to receive the email.

4.  **Scheduling & Selection Loop:**
    *   The script enters a loop that continues as long as there are pending recipients identified in Step 3.

5.  **Wait Random Interval:**
    *   Before sending the next email, the script pauses execution for a randomly determined duration within a configured range (e.g., between 30 seconds and 5 minutes).

6.  **Select Next Recipient:**
    *   From the list of pending recipients identified in Step 3, the script selects the next recipient to process (e.g., the first one in the filtered list).

7.  **Prepare Personalized Email:**
    *   The email subject line is set.
    *   The provided email body template is used. The placeholder `(Name)` is replaced with the 'FirstName' value of the selected recipient.
    *   The 'To' address is set to the recipient's 'Email' address.

8.  **Send Email:**
    *   The script connects to the configured SMTP server using the provided credentials.
    *   The prepared email is sent to the selected recipient.
    *   (Implicit: Basic error detection for sending failure might occur here, though sophisticated handling is out of scope).

9.  **Update Status (In-Memory & Persistent):**
    *   **In-Memory:** The status of the selected recipient in the script's loaded data structure is updated to '✅'.
    *   **Persist to Excel:** The script opens the original Excel file, finds the row corresponding to the just-sent recipient (e.g., by matching the email address), updates the 'Status' cell in that row to '✅', and saves the Excel file.

10. **Check Daily Report Trigger:**
    *   The script checks if the predefined "End of Day" condition has been met (e.g., current time matches a configured time, or a 24-hour cycle is complete).

11. **Generate Daily Report:**
    *   If the "End of Day" trigger is met, the script calculates:
        *   The total number of emails sent so far (by counting '✅' entries in the data/Excel).
        *   The number of recipients remaining (by counting non-'✅' entries).
    *   This information is formatted into a report string.

12. **Send Daily Report:**
    *   An email is composed with a subject indicating it's a daily report.
    *   The body of the email contains the report string generated in Step 11.
    *   This report email is sent to the three hardcoded report recipient email addresses.

13. **Continue or Terminate:**
    *   After sending an email (Steps 4-9) and potentially the daily report (Steps 10-12), the script checks if there are still pending recipients remaining (by re-evaluating the condition in Step 3).
    *   If pending recipients exist, the loop continues from Step 4 (Wait Random Interval).
    *   If no pending recipients remain *and* the daily report for the final day has been sent, the script terminates.

14. **Process Termination (Final Report):**
    *   If the process completes sending to all recipients before the regular "End of Day" trigger, it should ideally send a final report indicating completion and the total sent count, then terminate. (This is a slight refinement to Step 13).

**9. Assumptions**

*   The Excel file path is correctly specified and accessible by the script.
*   The required columns (`Email`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, `Status`) exist in the Excel file with exactly those header names.
*   The script has necessary permissions to read from and write to the specified Excel file.
*   The provided SMTP server details and credentials are correct and allow sending emails.
*   The script runs continuously or is scheduled to run until all emails are sent.
*   The definition of "End of Day" for reporting is clear and implemented correctly in the script's logic.
*   File locking issues with the Excel file (e.g., if someone opens it while the script is running) are handled gracefully by the script (e.g., retrying or skipping the update).
*   The volume of emails does not exceed the sending limits of the configured SMTP server within the operational period.

**10. Dependencies**

*   Python 3.x environment.
*   Required Python libraries (e.g., `pandas` for Excel handling, `smtplib` and `email` for sending emails, `time` or `random` for scheduling).
*   Operating System with file system access.
*   Accessible SMTP server.

**11. Potential Future Enhancements**

*   Implement robust error handling and logging (e.g., for failed sends, file access issues).
*   Use a configuration file (e.g., `.ini`, `.json`) instead of hardcoding sensitive information or parameters.
*   Add support for other file formats (e.g., CSV).
*   Include more detailed reporting metrics (e.g., sent today, sent this week, estimated time to completion).
*   Implement a simple command-line interface for starting/stopping or viewing basic status.
*   Add a feature to handle recipients marked with a specific status (e.g., 'Exclude', 'Bounce').
